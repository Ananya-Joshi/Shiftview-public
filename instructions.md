# Translation Demo: Senior Thesis Project

This interactive website highlights some of the models from my senior thesis. Here is 1 of the 11 models I have created. Please be patient as the translations require time to generate. Additionally, because some of the data is uncensored, please be advised that there may be cursing and confusing speech. I am not repsonsible for the translations generated. This is simply a guide for what is possible with moral reframing. 

Do note that only once instance is online (please don't abuse the app). If it is not currently working, please try again later.
